## Task 2: Terraform Installation and Nginx Deployment

1. **Research and Installation**:
   - Verifying the terraform installation
   ```sh
    suwilanji@SUWILANJI-PCV3:~/learn-terraform-docker-container$ terraform --version
    Terraform v1.9.0-dev
    on linux_amd64
    + provider registry.terraform.io/kreuzwerker/docker v3.0.2
    suwilanji@SUWILANJI-PCV3:~/learn-terraform-docker-container$
   ```

2. **Nginx Deployment**:
   - Step 1 : Build 
   - Initializing terraform
   ```sh
    suwilanji@SUWILANJI-PCV3:~/learn-terraform-docker-container$ terraform init
    Initializing the backend...
    Initializing provider plugins...
    - Reusing previous version of kreuzwerker/docker from the dependency lock file
    - Using previously-installed kreuzwerker/docker v3.0.2

    Terraform has been successfully initialized!

    You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
    any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
    should now work.

    If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
    rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
    commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
    suwilanji@SUWILANJI-PCV3:~/learn-terraform-docker-container$ terraform fmt
    main.tf
    suwilanji@SUWILANJI-PCV3:~/learn-terraform-docker-container$ terraform validate
    Success! The configuration is valid.

    suwilanji@SUWILANJI-PCV3:~/learn-terraform-docker-container$ terraform apply

    Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

    Terraform will perform the following actions:

   ```
   - Showing that the docker image is running 
   ```sh
    suwilanji@SUWILANJI-PCV3:~/learn-terraform-docker-container$ docker ps

    Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 2 to destroy.

    Do you really want to destroy all resources?
    Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
    There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

    Enter a value: yes

    docker_container.nginx: Destroying... [id=6d7121ea7cb11e9533ef330439b9cdd52181d15bcc76cc29b349668de40752c8]
    docker_container.nginx: Destruction complete after 1s
    docker_image.nginx: Destroying... [id=sha256:fffffc90d343cbcb01a5032edac86db5998c536cd0a366514121a45c6723765cnginx:latest]
    docker_image.nginx: Destruction complete after 1s

    Destroy complete! Resources: 2 destroyed.
   
   ```
   
 # Define input variables
   - First I create a variables.tf file and define a new variable. Then I update the `docker_container` resource in main.tf to use the new varable.
     ```sh
        variable "container_name" {
        description = "Value of the name for the Docker container"
        type        = string
        default     = "ExampleNginxContainer"
        }
     ```
  - I then apply the config and overide the container name.
    ```sh
    suwilanji@SUWILANJI-PCV3:~/learn-terraform-docker-container$ terraform apply -var "container_name=YetAnotherName"
    docker_image.nginx: Refreshing state... [id=sha256:fffffc90d343cbcb01a5032edac86db5998c536cd0a366514121a45c6723765cnginx:latest]

    Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
    -/+ destroy and then create replacement

    Terraform will perform the following actions:
