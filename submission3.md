## Task 2: Practice with Git Reset Command

- Checking out to git-reset-practice
```
suwil@SUWILANJI-PCV3 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/First Year Masters/Third Semester/Devops/Lab 1/Sum24-intro-labs (master)
$ git checkout git-reset-practice
Switched to a new branch 'git-reset-practice'
branch 'git-reset-practice' set up to track 'origin/git-reset-practice'.

```
- Making three commits
```
suwil@SUWILANJI-PCV3 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/First Year Masters/Third Semester/Devops/Lab 1/Sum24-intro-labs (git-reset-practice)
$ echo "First commit" > file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "First commit"

echo "Second commit" >> file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Second commit"

$ git status
On branch git-reset-practice
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/git-reset-practice' by 3 commits.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

```

- Using ```git reset --soft HEAD~1``` removes the last commit from the current branch, but the file changes will stay in the working tree. In addition the changes will remain on the index.
```
suwil@SUWILANJI-PCV3 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/First Year Masters/Third Semester/Devops/Lab 1/Sum24-intro-labs (git-reset-practice)
$ git reset --soft HEAD~1

suwil@SUWILANJI-PCV3 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/First Year Masters/Third Semester/Devops/Lab 1/Sum24-intro-labs (git-reset-practice)
$ git status
On branch git-reset-practice
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/git-reset-practice' by 2 commits.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   file.txt

```
- Checking the contents of the file shows that the working tree remains unchanged.
```
suwil@SUWILANJI-PCV3 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/First Year Masters/Third Semester/Devops/Lab 1/Sum24-intro-labs (git-reset-practice)
$ cat file.txt
First commit
Second commit
Third commit
```
- Using ```git reset --soft HEAD~1``` will remove all uncommited changes and all untracked files as well as the changes introduced in the last commit. The changes won't stay the your working tree
```
suwil@SUWILANJI-PCV3 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/First Year Masters/Third Semester/Devops/Lab 1/Sum24-intro-labs (git-reset-practice)
$ git reset --hard HEAD~1
HEAD is now at 06c6b10 First commit

$ git status
On branch git-reset-practice
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/git-reset-practice' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

```
- The last commit after the soft reset was second commit, after running a hard reset this commit is removed and only first commit remains. The working tree has also been cleard
```

$ cat file.txt

```
- git reflog shows the history of modifications made to the repository's HEAD pointer.
```
suwil@SUWILANJI-PCV3 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/First Year Masters/Third Semester/Devops/Lab 1/Sum24-intro-labs (git-reset-practice)
$ git reflog
